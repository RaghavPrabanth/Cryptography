ENCRYPTION:

WE CREATE A LIST OF TAMIL ASCII VALUES.GET THE INPUT OF AN IMAGE AS 8 BIT PIXEL, THIS IS CONSIDERED AS THE PLAIN TEXT .

SPLIT THE 8 BIT PLAIN TEXT INTO 2 EQUAL HALVES(EACH OF 4BITS).

GET A 32BIT KEY INPUT.

SPLIT THE 32BIT KEYS INTO 2BITS EACH , SO THAT WE OBTAIN 16 PAIRS. 

STORE ALL THE 16 SET OF KEYS IN A LIST. 

Y=INT(X[BYTE1] ,Z=INT(X[BYTE2])

CHECK WHETHER THE ABOVE 2 EXIST IN L1 , IF SO PRINT THE CIPHER TEXT. 



DECRYPTION:

THE OBTAINED CIPHER TEXT IS TAKEN AS THE INPUT.

THE CIPHER TEXT IS SPLITTED INTO 2 BYTES CBYTE1 AND CBYTE2.

ENTER THE SAME KEY USED FOR ENCRYPTION.

REVERSE TRACE THE ENCRYPTION METHOD TO DECRYPT THE CIPHERTEXT AND FIND THE PLAINTEXT
FOR ENCRYPTION
Ciphertext_Byte1 = List(Key(Plaintext_Byte1))

FOR DECRYPTION
Plaintext_Byte1 = „Äñùëòùëíùë¶„Äó^(‚àí1)(„Äñùêøùëñùë†ùë°„Äó^(‚àí1)(Ciphertext_Byte1))
